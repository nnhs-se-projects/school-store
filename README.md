# School Store App

# Description

The School Store App is a website that allows students to order school supplies online and schedule a time to pick the supplies up. Our group has so far created an order system, a way to add and remove items for sale, a on website spreadsheet for the quantity of inventory, and different web pages for each one of these items.

# Start

make sure to run "npm install nodemailer" in the terminal
your .env file needs to have 4 things in it
1. The MONGO_URI
2. the SESSION_SECRET
3. the EMAIL_PASSWORD
4. the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
our project currently has two separate google client ID's one for the live server, and one for local host.

Have fun coding!
